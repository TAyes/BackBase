## Architecture
This application uses the Model-View-ViewModel (refered to as MVVM) UI architecture,


## Structure

### Modules
- Include 
	*CityMap/MapViewController, 
	*FindCities/(View/CityTableCell,CitiesViewModel,CitiesTableController),(Model/City).

### Navigation
- Include Navigator, Destination

### Protocol
- Include CitiesLoader

### CommonComponents
- Include Network+Error,  Observable , Trie ..etc

### Extensions
- Include UITableView+Cell,  Array+Sort , UISearchBar+ActivityIndicator ..etc

### SupportingFiles
- Include cities.json

### Scenes
- Group of app scenes.

### Solution details,
- decode data from json file and save it in array
- used Trie data structure to save all cities
  Using Trie will need time proportional toÂ M * log N, where M is maximum string length and N is number of keys in tree. so we can search the key in O(M) time.
